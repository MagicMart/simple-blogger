## The weeks are too short

It is disconcerting how short the weeks seem now. Are there any mental exercises by which they can be stretched? If my brain was energised, would there be finer grains of detail to hold me longer in the moment? Tomorrow I will be stronger, hold infinity in the palm of my hand.
