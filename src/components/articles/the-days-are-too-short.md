## The days are too short

> To see a World in a Grain of Sand<br/>
> And a Heaven in a Wild Flower<br/>
> Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand<br/>
> And Eternity in an hour

> -   William Blake

It is alarming how short the days appear now. Life shouldn't be like looking down the wrong end of a telescope. If my brain was revitalised, would there be finer grains of detail to hold me longer in the moment? Tomorrow I will be stronger, hold infinity in the palm of my hand.
