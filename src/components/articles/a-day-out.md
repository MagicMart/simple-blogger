## A Day Out

<time>2019-11-13</time>

I remember a trip to the local park: I was just a boy, with uncombed hair, who would stay by a quacking duck or a continuously spurting fountain. My dad would often pick me up and hold me. My dad. That's my dad, I thought continuously.
The grass was bright green, the trees were full of leaves and the sun shone off the top of my dad's head.
What was gathering in that place, I say now with a grown-up mind, knowing that at that time of our walk through the bright green happy vegetation, my dad's dad had sailed his boat out too far? So, in the park that day he pointed to things as if trying to see.
A window on the world had been curtained: those faded eyes would no more take photographs of trees and leaves and bark texture and a scurrying beetle in the crevices of a rockery. Pointing to a mad-eyed pigeon was a kindness.
I go back â€“ to the park that is out there and the park that I can see when I close my eyes. And in that bright green happy park I see him pointing at nothing.
